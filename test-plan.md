## Objective

The objective of this test plan is to ensure the quality and functionality of the Automation Exercise clothing store system through the implementation of a Test Automation strategy.

## Scope

The test plan will cover all user flows identified in Test Scenarios, including navigation through views, interaction with products, the purchasing process, account creation, address management, payment, and order confirmation.

## Approach

The main focus will be on end-to-end (E2E) testing to simulate the behavior of the end user and validate functionality from the user's perspective.

## Strategy

- Utilize Cypress integrated with Cucumber to implement behavior-driven testing (BDD) from the user's perspective.
- Automate all user flows identified in Test Scenarios in the specified order.
- Design detailed test cases for each step of the user flows, focusing on data validation, navigation, and functionality.
- Utilize GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated test execution on each code commit.
